Because the serverfiles are to big and to keep the installation simple,
you need to download the server files from here:

Sandbox server Files:
https://sandboxmod.com/?p=download-server
downloads "sandbox_server_1.0.1.zip"

Bf2 Server Files:
<TO BE UPLOADED AS ZIP>
downloads "battlefield2_linux_server_1.5.3153.0.tar.gz"

and add them into this folder

-> use github LFS
